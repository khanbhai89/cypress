STEPS:
• candidate clones the repository to his local environment (git clone
<https://github.com/Inflectra/ui-test-automation-playground.git>)
• to setup up the UI Test Automation Playground in your local environment, follow the
README.MD file (from <https://github.com/inflectra/ui-test-automation-playground>)
• Once the app is started inside your browser, there are 17 functional links that can be
accessed. Each link that is embedded on the page is treated as separate functionality
(there are in total 17 different functionalities that demonstrate different automation
functionalities on the <https://github.com/inflectra/ui-test-automation-playground> app)
• candidate implements the automation solution
• scenarios to be automated:
o Overlapped Element
o AJAX Data
o Visibility
o Dynamic Table
o Sample App
o Text Input
o Progress Bar
• automation Test cases should all reside within a single folder. For that, a new folder needs
to be created
